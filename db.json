{"id":9,"name":"Boston's Forgotten Felines","contact":"Joni Nelson","email":"bffcatrescue@gmail.com","descr":"We want to help end the overpopulation of feral and homeless cats on the streets of Boston.  To this end we trap, neuter (or spay) feral and homeless cats.  We coordinate other veterinary care for these cats when necessary.  We release fixed feral cats and ensure their survival by providing daily care for them in their street homes (known as colonies), including monitoring for health, safety and new arrivals, feeding, providing shelter and other protection from the elements.  We evaluate homeless cats for adoptability and turn these cats over to local, no-kill animal shelters or foster homes.  We provide support to these shelters and foster homes upon request.  And, although we believe that a program of TNR (Trap, Neuter, Release) is a vital part of ending overpopulation, we know that it is not the only part.  Education is a very important part of the solution. We provide education to the public about the importance of spay and neuter programs and the about problems faced by homeless cats.  We will train volunteers to help us with any or all of these activities.","dates":"varies (reach out to them for more information)","location":"Various locations throughout Boston"},

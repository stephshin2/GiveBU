We often go back to this statement from Stephen North, considered the father of the Writing Center movement, in order to remind ourselves that we are developing writers, not fixing papers. We are empowering teenagers through writing. We currently operate a Writing Center at Boston International Newcomers Academy (BINCA), located in Dorchester. The school is made up of English Language Learner (ELL) students with varying levels of writing and English abilities. The tutorâ€™s role is to help students develop their writing skills with classroom assignments, college essays, scholarship applications, and other pieces of writing. The Writing Center is open Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 8 am-3 pm, and on Fridays from 8 am-1 pm, and we are seeking a 2-3 hour weekly commitment for the entire school year. This is a great opportunity to support ELL students and help develop them into powerful writers!',' Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays from 8-3 pm and Fridays from 8-1 pm','Boston International High School 100 Maxwell Street Boston MA 02121 in Dorchester',95),(53,'Y2Y','Ashley Wang','volunteer.y2y@gmail.com','We are seeking volunteers to help keep our summertime, student-run homeless shelters operating for the next ~7 weeks during Y2Y Harvard Squareâ€™s Summer Season. There are 4 shifts daily: Dinner: 6:15 PM - 9:15 PM Evening: 9:00 PM - 11:15 PM Overnight: 11 PM - 9:00 AM Breakfast: 6:30 AM - 9:00 AM Times on weekends are slightly different: Friday & Saturday Overnight: 11 PM - 10:00 AM Saturday & Sunday Breakfast: 7:30 AM - 10:00 AM  Descriptions of the shifts: Breakfast: Come in bright and early to greet our guests! You\'ll be making breakfast and helping to clean the shelter (an invaluable service!) after all the guests leave at 8:00 am. Dinner: You\'ll be cooking and serving dinner, talking with guests, and perhaps making a food pick-up run from one of the many shops that donate to us. Evening: On the evening shift, help is often needed in the kitchen to clean up after dinner. This is also a relaxed time to visit the guests as they prepare for bed.  Overnight: You\'ll be hanging with other volunteer and night-owl guests, basically having more good conversations, watching movies, doing laundry, reading, baking cookies, and more! This is a fantastic shifts because it\'s a rare opportunity to have long conversations and get to know people well. Don\'t worry: we do take turns sleeping - the night is typically divided into three sub-shifts and you will be asleep for two of them (there is a staff room with bed, so you\'ll be able to sleep 5-6 hours when it is not your turn to be awake).',' June 12th - August 7th time dependent on shift',' Y2Y Harvard Square Shelter: 1 Church St Cambridge MA 02138',100);
